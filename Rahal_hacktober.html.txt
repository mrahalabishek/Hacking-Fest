<h2> What is brute force attack ? </h2>
<p> A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. 
The hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords, often using a computer to test a wide range of combinations, 
until they find the correct login information.
These are one of the most common forms of brute force attack and use a list of words in a dictionary to crack passwords. 
Other types of attack may use a list of commonly used passwords. If your password is 'password', for example, 
a brute force bot would be able to crack your password within seconds. </p>
